# Add Travel Ireland

This is a readme file for my GitHub repo. First website project for Code Institute.
We learn HTML and CSS.

## We Live to Travel
The main purpose of the website is to promote tourism, to show the wildest and most beutiful places in Ireland.
I want present information, photos and locations of interesting places that are worth to seeing.
You havent seen Ireland like this before !
Good idea, right?

The website supposed to contain:
* Home page
* Gallery (Photos)
* Contact page

Table of Contents
* Headers
* Useful Links
* Images
* Commands 
* Reference Links

### Headers
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline style:
Alt-H1
======
Alt-H2
------
