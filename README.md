# Add Travel Ireland

This is a readme file for my GitHub repo. First website project for Code Institute.
We learn HTML and CSS.

## We Live to Travel
The main purpose of the website is to promote tourism, to show the wildest and most beutiful places in Ireland.
You havent seen Ireland like this before !
Good idea, right?

The website supposed to contain:
* Home page
* Gallery (Photos)
* Contact page



To browse the pages, in the terminal, type: python3 -m http.server
---

Happy coding!
