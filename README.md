# Introduction - Add Travel Ireland

This is a readme file for my GitHub repo. First website project for Code Institute.
We learn HTML and CSS. 
From the beginning of my adventure with coding the first idea for a website was a travel site. Simple because I like traveling a lot and I stayed with that idea. I managed to see most of the presented places, so it was easier for me to search and add information.
The website's logo was created from the first letters of my name, plus the word Travel.

## Goals 
The main goal of the website was to present Ireland in an eye-catching way. I would even say fabulous way. Through this website people will be able to find ideas for travel and leisure activities.

## Description 
We Live to Travel. Is one of my slogans, because what else to do with our free time.
The main purpose of the website is to promote tourism, to show the wildest and most beutiful places in Ireland.
We have to remember that everything can be an attraction: monuments, cliffs, a good restaurant, a bicycle trail, canoeing, a vantage point, a forest, a ruin or a town nearby.
On this website I want to present information, photos and locations of interesting places that are worth to seeing.
You havent seen Ireland like this before !

#### The website supposed to contain:
* Home page
* Gallery (Photos)
* Contact page

#### Technologies
* HTML - will help build a solid foundation.
* CSS - define the appearance of elements and their design.
* Balsamic.com - Wireframes
* Gitpod - Container based development platform. Ready-to-code development environments in the cloud accessible through your browser and your local IDE.
* Github - The most popular of the websites that host Git repositories in the cloud. Thanks to a service like GitHub, we can share our code with other developers and work with them remotely over time.

## Conclusion
Creating a website is an adventure and a real challenge. The greatest joy, however, is the moment when everything that has been done works without any problems :P Reflecting on the whole aspect of the website, I know that I could have made the code clearer and more readable, I think there is a lot of mess there. But it is a great lesson for the future. In my opinion, the website looks very good visually and that's what it's about.
