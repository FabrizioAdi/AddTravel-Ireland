## Description 
We Live to Travel.
The main purpose of the website is to promote tourism, to show the wildest and most beutiful places in Ireland.
We have to remember that everything can be an attraction: monuments, a good restaurant, a bicycle trail, canoeing, a vantage point, a forest, a ruin or a town nearby.
On this website I want to present information, photos and locations of interesting places that are worth to seeing.
You havent seen Ireland like this before !
Good idea, right?

#### The website supposed to contain:
* Home page
* Gallery (Photos)
* Contact page

#### Technologies
* HTML - will help build a solid foundation.
* CSS - define the appearance of elements and their design.

## Headers
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6


Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline style:
Alt-H1
Alt-H2

## Conclusion
Creating a website is an adventure and a real challenge. The greatest joy, however, is the moment when everything that has been done works without any problems :P Reflecting on the whole aspect of the website, I know that I could have made the code clearer and more readable, I think there is a lot of mess there. But it is a great lesson for the future. In my opinion, the website looks very good visually and that's what it's about.
