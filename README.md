# Introduction - Add Travel Ireland
[I am the link to the website](https://fabrizioadi.github.io/AddTravel-Ireland/)
Hello good people !

 A website for people who would like to coming on hollidays to Ireland. Also for people who would like to know more about Green Island and its most beutiful places. This website promotes tourism, gives ideas and information with little bit general knowledge, basically encouraging sightseeing.

 I wanted to create a simple project with little text, I hope I did it. In my opinion people as myself donâ€™t like busy looking websites, where is lots of text to read. I may be wrong but should the website look like a book to read? :) I like simplicity and beauty.

From the beginning of my adventure with coding the first idea for a website was a travel site. Simple because I like traveling a lot and I stayed with that idea. I managed to see most of the presented places, so it was easier for me to search and add information and photos. The website's logo idea was created from the first letters of my name, plus the word Travel. I can't yet create an appropriate drawing logo myself, so I used a google image logo. Although the most suitable logo would still be the palm logo.

## Goals
The main goal of the website was to present Ireland in an eye-catching way. I would even say fabulous way. Through this website people will be able to find ideas for travel and leisure activities.

## Description
We Live to Travel. 
Is one of my slogans, because what else to do with our free time. Not including coding.
The main purpose of the website is to promote tourism, to show the wildest and most beutiful places in Ireland.
We have to remember that everything can be an attraction: monuments, cliffs, a good restaurant, a bicycle trail, canoeing, a vantage point, a forest, a ruin or a town nearby.
On this website I want to present information, photos and locations of interesting places that are worth to seeing.

The website consists of a three pages: home page, gallery, contact.

## Conclusion
Creating a website is an adventure and a real challenge. The greatest joy, however, is the moment when everything that has been done works without any problems :P Reflecting on the whole aspect of the website, I know that I could have made the code clearer and more readable, I think there is a lot of mess there. But it is a great lesson for the future. In my opinion, the website looks very good visually and that's what it's about.
